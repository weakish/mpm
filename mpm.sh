## Minimalistic password manager 

# I use a simple plain text file to store password for websites.

# The syntax is very simple.  It records a short name, site url, password
# and (optional) notes.  Usually I use the same username and email address,
# so no need to record them again and again. (If I do use a different username
# or email address, they go into the optional notes field.)

#    example http://example.org password additional notes

# Requires Python 3

# Versions

semver=0.5 # Released on 2013-02
# - quoted here-documents to avoid shell expansion.
# - improve password strength
# - encrypt the record file via gpg (again)

# semver=0.4 # Released on 2012-02
# improve password strength

# semver=0.3 # Released on 2011-04
# - Use plain text record file again:
#   Encryption, if needed, can be done at file system level
#   separately, for example, a fuse file system
# - Use space instead of comma to separate fields in record
#   file, since comma is allowed in URL
# - addRecord(): remove option '-e' from echo for sh compatibility

# semver=0.2 # Released on 2009-08
# - Use gpg to encrypt the record file

# semver=0.1 # Released on 2009-08


# The record file

# inspired by http://xkcd.com/936/
# But I use 5 words instead of 4, since 5 words will achieve an entropy of:
#     log(99171)/log(2)*5 = 82.988
# This is enough.
# NIST recommends 80-bits for the most secure passwords.
